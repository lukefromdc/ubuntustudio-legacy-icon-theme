Until the build system for this has been set up, it won't be possible to install it with the usual "make install" sequence
until then, the entire icon theme is still installable by simply downloading the tarball and opening to a directory, then 
the entire UbuntuStudio_Legacy directory into /usr/share/themes and setting permissions to allow all users to "access files"

A proper build system will be set up but is not ready yet
