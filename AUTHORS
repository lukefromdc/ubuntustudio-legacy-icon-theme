Icons based on elementary designed and developed by Daniel Foré <Daniel.p.Fore@gmail.com>
This variant - supporting all Desktop Environments, but developed for Xfce - is currently maintained by Simon Steinbeiß <simon@xfce.org> It still holds many of the symlinks that upstream elementary dropped (for good reasons).
